# Displaying-0-to-9-on-7-Segment-Display-using-8051-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to display the numbers 0 to 9 sequentially on a 7-segment display using an 8051 microcontroller. 
# Description
This project demonstrates how to display the numbers 0 to 9 sequentially on a 7-segment display using an 8051 microcontroller. The microcontroller is programmed in Embedded C to send the appropriate signals to the 7-segment display, making it show each digit in order. The simulation is done using Proteus, allowing the behavior of the circuit to be tested without needing physical hardware.
The project provides a hands-on understanding of interfacing a 7-segment display with the 8051 microcontroller, which is commonly used in embedded systems to display numerical data.
# Features:
Microcontroller Used: 8051 (AT89C51 or equivalent)
Programming Language: Embedded C
Simulation Software: Proteus
Display: Common Cathode 7-segment display
# How it Works:
The 7-segment display is connected to the P2 port of the 8051 microcontroller.
The microcontroller sends the corresponding binary pattern to the 7-segment display to represent digits from 0 to 9.
A small delay is added between each number, so the digits are displayed one at a time.
The Proteus simulation provides a visual representation of the numbers as they are displayed on the 7-segment display.
# Simulation:
The Proteus simulation accurately shows the digits cycling from 0 to 9 on the 7-segment display, helping verify the correct functionality of the microcontroller program without the need for physical components.
